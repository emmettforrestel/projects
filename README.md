This presentation explains the work I have done in January 2025 for the Future Circular Collider for Electron-Positron. 

This was an in person workshop, 40 hours a week at MIT, in collaboration with MIT, Brown, and CERN.

I presented this slideshow on 1/31/25 as the culmination of this work at a high energy particle physics conference at MIT.
